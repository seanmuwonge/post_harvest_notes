In this storage process, the air around the food in the package is converted to another form. In this way the original new product status can be extended. Shelf life is extended with MAP as it slows down product degradation. MAP is used for a variety of products, in which the gas mixture in the package depends on the type of product, packaging materials and storage temperature. Meat and fish require very low penetration films so in non-breathable products (meat, fish, cheese, etc.) high-strength films are used. Fruits and vegetables are breath-taking products where packaging and product interaction are important. If the permeability (of O2 and CO2) of the packaging film is converted into product respiration, a modified air of balance will be established in the package and the shelf life of the product will increase. Instead of storing food when it is too hot (sterilized) or cold (frozen), MAP uses \u201cminimal processing\u201d - preserving food with a total amount of quality damage, texture, taste and texture. Several technologies have been developed with the aim of restoring a mixture of headspace gas with the right amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide to store the product until it is used by the user.
